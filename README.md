This small piece of code represents a command in the game World of Warcraft, which can be executed to hide the chatbox in the interface. The purpose of packaging this command into an AddOn for the game, was to automate the process of hiding the chat whenever the game is loaded and reloaded. AddOns are added to the game files, and thus executed with the game.

**AddOn**

The table of contents (.toc) file is utilised by the game interface to enable and disable the AddOn, as it references the Lua (.lua) file containing the executable code. This code is executed as it would be through the in-game chat, but does not necessarily require user interaction, and can be executed in response to game events.
